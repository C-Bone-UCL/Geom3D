Welcome to the Repository made for Cyprien Bone's 2023-2024 MSci Project at Imperial College London

The developper script used to execute an experiment with the package can be found at:
src/geom3d/dev_scripts/run_training.py

An example experiment:
python run_training.py --model_name SchNet --num_molecules 500 --target_name combined 

Some Jupyter Notebooks were generated to show examples of the different experiments one can run using the package in the example_notebooks folder.

The data collected during the project was saved to dataframes that can be found in the relecant experiment folders.
