<h3 align="center">This is my 2023-2024 MSci Project carried out at Imperial College London</h3>

- ðŸ”­ This is a [A Geometric GNN package to investigate property prediction for Organic Semiconductors](https://github.com/cb1319/Geom3D/)

<h3 align="left">The developper script used to execute an experiment with the package can be found at:</h3>

- **src/geom3d/dev_scripts/run_training.py**

<h3 align="left">An example experiment:</h3>

- python run_training.py --model_name SchNet --num_molecules 500 --target_name combined
